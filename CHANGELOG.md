# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- Support for Anthropic's `claude-3.7` series models (`ra_aid/models_params.py`, `tests/ra_aid/test_anthropic_token_limiter.py`).
- Support for Fireworks AI provider and models (`fireworks/firefunction-v2`, `fireworks/dbrx-instruct`) (`ra_aid/models_params.py`, `ra_aid/llm.py`).
- Implicit think tag detection: `process_thinking_content` now checks for `<think>` tags even if `supports_think_tag` is not explicitly `True` in model config, provided it's not `False` and the content starts with the tag (`ra_aid/text/processing.py`, `tests/ra_aid/text/test_process_thinking.py`).
- Command-line arguments `--project-dir` and `--db-path` added to `ra-aid usage latest` and `ra-aid usage all` subcommands for specifying database location (`ra_aid/scripts/cli.py`, `ra_aid/scripts/all_sessions_usage.py`, `ra_aid/scripts/last_session_usage.py`).
- Reinitialization capability for Singleton classes via `_initialize` method (`ra_aid/utils/singleton.py`).
- Metadata tracking (`model_name`, `provider`) added during LLM initialization (`ra_aid/llm.py`, `tests/ra_aid/test_llm.py`).

### Changed

- **Refactored Callback Handling:** Replaced `AnthropicCallbackHandler` with a generalized `DefaultCallbackHandler` located in `ra_aid/callbacks/default_callback_handler.py`. This new handler supports multiple providers, improves cost/token tracking logic, standardizes initialization, enhances database interaction for trajectory logging, and provides better context management (`ra_aid/callbacks/default_callback_handler.py`, `ra_aid/agent_utils.py`, `ra_aid/console/output.py`, `tests/ra_aid/callbacks/test_default_callback_handler.py`, `tests/ra_aid/test_token_usage_tracking.py`).
- **Refactored Thinking Processing:** Significantly updated `process_thinking_content` in `ra_aid/text/processing.py` for clearer logic flow. It now explicitly handles structured thinking (list format) separately from string-based `<think>` tag extraction. The logic for tag extraction now depends on the `supports_think_tag` configuration value (True: always check, False: never check, None: check only if content starts with `<think>`) (`ra_aid/text/processing.py`, `tests/ra_aid/text/test_process_thinking.py`, `tests/ra_aid/agent_backends/test_ciayn_agent_think_tag.py`).
- **Refactored Token Limiting:** Renamed `sonnet_35_state_modifier` to `base_state_modifier` in `ra_aid/anthropic_token_limiter.py` for broader applicability and adjusted associated logic (`ra_aid/anthropic_token_limiter.py`, `ra_aid/agent_utils.py`, `tests/ra_aid/test_anthropic_token_limiter.py`).
- Updated LLM initialization (`initialize_llm` in `ra_aid/llm.py`) to include provider/model metadata and refine DeepSeek provider logic for different DeepSeek models (`ra_aid/llm.py`, `tests/ra_aid/test_llm.py`).
- Improved rate limit error handling and retry logic in `_handle_api_error` (`ra_aid/agent_utils.py`).
- Removed redundant console output from `ripgrep_search` tool; results are now only in the returned dictionary (`ra_aid/tools/ripgrep.py`).
- Updated numerous unit tests across the codebase to reflect the extensive refactoring in callbacks, thinking processing, token limiting, and LLM initialization.
- Updated project dependencies as recorded in `uv.lock` and `pyproject.toml`.

### Fixed

- Corrected an import path typo in `ra_aid/dependencies.py`.
- Ensured the correct callback handler instance (`DefaultCallbackHandler`) is used for fetching cost information for display (`ra_aid/console/output.py`).
- Addressed various test failures arising from the refactoring of core components.

### Removed

- Removed the dedicated `ra_aid/callbacks/anthropic_callback_handler.py` file. Its functionality has been merged and generalized into `ra_aid/callbacks/default_callback_handler.py`.
